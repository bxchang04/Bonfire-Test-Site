Case Study Notes:
For the buttons, I each grid element clickable in their entirety, instead of only making the 'View Case Study' buttons clickable.
As hinted by the photoshop specs, this gives the user larger targets to click/tap, when compared to the smaller 'View Case Study' buttons). 
This leads to a more streamlined user experience and fewer wasted clicks/taps.
