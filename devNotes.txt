Case Study Notes:
For the buttons, I each made grid element clickable in their entirety, instead of only making the 'View Case Study' buttons clickable.
As hinted by the photoshop specs, this gives the user larger targets to click/tap, when compared to forcing the user to aim for the smaller 'View Case Study' buttons. 
As a result, the user experieneces a more streamlined experience and fewer wasted clicks/taps.



    NOTES:
    Pay attention to mouse over and animations--esp case studies!
      Mouse over red line, focus, view case study button w/ href #
    Pay attention to link colors
    SASS!
    CSS Grid and Grid fallback
    MEDIA QUERIES!
    IE conflicts/compatability (autoprefixer)

    ColorPicker and color matching. TURN OFF WINDOWS NIGHT LIGHT to ensure color accuracy.
