Requirements:

Take the ​attached ​photoshop document and turn it into a single working web page. You can build in any way that you want using HTML, JS, CSS with a few exceptions:

​- ​Do not use front end frameworks for JS (jQuery is fine, but no react, vue, ember, etc).
​- ​Do not use Bootstrap or similar css libraries
​- ​Use Sass to write css

The links on the page don’t need to go anywhere so you can set the href attribute to “#”. There are only a few requirements:

​- ​The final page should work across all screen sizes from a full width desktop down to mobile
​- ​The final page should work across modern versions of Chrome, Firefox, and Safari. IE can suck it, but we should at least determine if there are any major conflicts in IE 11 and Edge
​- ​The tabs that say “all”, “even”, and “odd” should show/hide the appropriate boxes below. It should start off with “all” selected and all boxes showing.
​- ​We've included an example of what the boxes should look like when the user hovers over one.


Known Issues:

- IE11 is incompatable with default CSS grid and JS script. Implemented IE10+-only styling as visua workaround.
